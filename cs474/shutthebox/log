----  -------  ----  --------------
09/26  09:00pm 2:00  read assignment and played several games to help me
                     understand the rules
09/27 06:30pm  8:00  figured out algorithim and got output working for player two estimate and move, 4/11
09/28 01:00pm  1:20  added memoization, figured out how to combine player one and player two function to get player one expected, currently passed 7/11 and only have player one --expect left
      04:30pm  4:00  realized that I was doing range(1,6) instead of range(1,7), now passing 8/11
      10:30pm  3:30  was getting p1 --expected values slightly off, learned from a piazza question that I was
                     supposed to check if sum(S') <= of > 6 instead of original S. Also figured out my own memoization
                     function. now passing 11/11!

I discussed my solution with: 

It was rather intimidating getting started on this project because I knew I had to generate every possible outcome, 
AND keep track of the probability of ssaid outcomes. Also I didn't originally know about memoization, so my 
original implementation was really slow and I didn't know why. Towards the end it was frusterating because my p1 estimates
were the only thing left, and the answers I was getting were only .001 decimal places off. learned from a piazza question that I was
supposed to check if sum(S') <= of > 6 instead of original S. After that, rewrote memoization function which took a while
because I was figuring out the right date types to store the keys in.
