ESTIMATE of time to complete assignment: 15 hours

Date  Started  Spent Work completed
----  -------  ----  --------------
11/15 02:00pm 3:00  read assignment and pseudocoded with Ileana, currently q-learning is running for 9.000016927719116 seconds
			   so need to get that down, but the percentage I'm getting is betwteen .33 and .12 so that's good!
              2:00  fixed Q learning time soit's below 9 seconds, printed out bucket times visited and trying to get them even
11/16 02:20pm 1:30  went to office hours, then fixed so i have a 3x3 bucket for each possible action, up to .381 for 0 9 250000
      09:15pm 2:30  reconfigued a bit
11/17 08:00pm 5:30  went to office hours and reconfigured, currently at .42 ... returned to my original algorithim, now getting .511 consistently!

I discussed my solution with: Ileana Valdez, we pseudocoded together and talked through the assignment so we would have
a high level understanding of it

THis pset was extremely tedious. and i was hearing a lot of different perspectives and methods from the teaching team, so I confused myself a bit because I was trying to 
implement methods that were at times conflicting and non-intuitive. I did have the basic algorithim right though, and once I returned to my original implementation 
of things It worked well, I was at .46! After that I just had to tweak my buckets, which wasn't too bad. The hardest part was knowing how to change variables methodically,
since there were so many options for changing it was hard to know which to change.
