10/25 09:00pm 2:00  read assignment and made input reading, outputs list of possible sum combonations
10/28 08:00pm 8:00  went to office hours, finally understanding mcts and ucb, currently 1000 runs gets .14
10/29 01:00pm 7:00  went to office hours, getting .3
10/31 08:00pm 3:00  currently getting above .5!

I discussed my solution with: Ileana Valdez, she told me that when returning the final move, it should be the 
max wins/turns value for the original node''s children, instead of maxinizing ucb for them

This pset was HARDDD. I used 3 late days for it, I think it was especially hard because I struggled when
testing, considering how long it took. Also, there were a few things in the algorithim that I didn't originally
realize from the class notes. Definitely spent a lot time at office hours. Just proud that I finially finished. 
I didn't originally understand the fact that you has to traverse till you found a node that could be expanded. 
I just thought you went through all the children of a node and then kept moving from there. Glad to be finished!
