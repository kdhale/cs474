----  -------  ----  --------------
9/08  04:00pm  2:00  read assignment and played several games to help me
                     understand the rules, pseudo coded and decided my language 
                     (python), started writing a rough main and recursive function
09/12 12:20pm  1:00  Worked on my algorithm for checking possible moves
      06:50pm  0:30  Finished algorithim
09/13 11:45am  6:00  connected ssh, figured out how to read from stdin and run test cases
      10:30pm  5:00  created and tested connected components function, tested possible moves function
09/14 11:00am  2:30  finally got output in correct format, can not run tests! undid recursive moves that don't work, reached 7/9  
      03:45pm  0:15  reformatted input to take in double digit numbers, now passes 9/9!

I discussed my solution with: Went to office hours


This is my first time using the zoo in about a year, so I took a while getting comfortable with the terminal ans sshing into the zoo again.
Also, I'm not as confident in python, so even learning how to take in input and parse through the lines of the input took some time. Also, 
there were so many different board states that i didn'nt think about initially, including the ability to climb from one stack to another,
being able to go onto tipped over boxes, etc. The backtracking algorithim helped a lot, but I still took a while to remember to undo solutions 
that didn't work, remember which grid state to return to, etc.
